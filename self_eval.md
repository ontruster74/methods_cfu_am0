# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I am proud that I was able to complete the GitHub Mod 0 exercises in a timely and bug-free fashion.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

They allow you to use a given block of useful code many times throughout a given project without having to retype the actual code over and over again.
Methods also make code adaptable to input from users and other programs, providing a way for different sections of a program to interact with each other without having to rewrite them.
